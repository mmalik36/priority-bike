              <h2 class="indenttext">Our Story</h2>
                <p class="indenttext3"> Priority Bicycles is a small New York City bike manufacturer. Their office is in lower Manhattan that showcases their fleet of quality bikes. The creator of priority bikes is Dave Weiner. He decided to create Priority Bicycles after becoming frustrated with being unable to recommend quality leisure bikes to his close friends. On July 14, 2014, he launched a Kickstarter campaign looking to raise $30,000 to start his company but ended up with a total of $565,000 raised by over 1500 backers. Today the company has a variety of different sport, children, and everyday bicycles and accessories. We chose to create a 3-wheeled lightweight, foldable, belt driven bicycle called the Priority Fold. The Fold can be customized with a basket, baby carriage, and other accessories which gives our customers a variety of options.</p>

             <h1>What separates us from the rest?</h1>
             <h2 class="indenttext">Thinking one step ahead for you</h2>
                <p class="indenttext3">Our bike would ultimately be the same version, size, and model; however, depending on customer needs it can come with one complimentary starter attachment. Any addition special attachments would be considered a “add on” and would require additional purchase. Two of the attachments we offer are baby carriages and baskets; these attachments vary from different sizes to functions to suit children of different age group and customer preferences. The bike comes in different colors to suit personal characteristic and taste. We also offer to have custom design, custom color, gradient effects, or added monogramming at additional charges.  The bike would come folded in a medium sized box, which could easily fit into any trunk. The add on attachments would come in a separate box, and each boxed product would be fully cushioned with sturdy styrofoam and cardboard to avoid damage to the product during shipment. </p>
